# Geomarketing Project : Market Share Prediction
Ankita BHATTACHARYA
The code rendering all the results is called FP_Code.R. This contains 
data provided to us by professors and we also use data that was generated
beforehand. The market zones data was obtained from the script FP_Trade Area.R 
The cand.RData was generated using the script FP_Code.R and is commented so that
the user can run it to verify our results.


We finally get an app with several tabs. The map is interactive and we can see the market share of each of the 10 candidate shops.
We can also visualize the worst and best based on several criteria (sliders & checkboxes).
