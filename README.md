# Geomarketing Project : Market Share Prediction
Ankita BHATTACHARYA
The code rendering all the results is called FP_Code.R. This contains 
data provided to us by professors and we also use data that was generated
beforehand. The market zones data was obtained from the script FP_Trade Area.R 
The cand.RData was generated using the script FP_Code.R and is commented so that
the user can run it to verify our results.

Then the user must go to the file shinyapps_1.io.R to run the app. The server.R and
ui.R related files are in deployment_1.
